or, in an earlier phase of development, they were twined; that is, two ends of a doubled cord were twisted in such manner across the width of warp that each single warp thread was caught between the twists -an expedient way of dis­tributing them evenly.|,|On short warps it was solved by lacing heading cords along the ends of the warp, gen­erally using heavier thread for this than for the rest of the fabric.|,|We find that the spacing of the warp created a special problem.|,|To isolate the other, we have to retrace again early stages of development.|,|The Loom 27 had to undergo further development and even merge its function with an­ other one before finding a place there.|,|If a no written language, no graph paper, and no highly intelligent people with pencils could manage such inventions, we should be able - easily I hope - to repeat at least these structures.|,|There are also triple weaves and quadruple weaves, and multiple-layered fabrics can be constructed, though they are rarely found.|,|double weaves are fabrics that have two separate layers which can be Double locked at both sides, at one side, or, within the fabric, at any number of places where the design asks for an exchange of top and bottom layers, usually of different colors.|,|Again, different weaves can be used in from and back, as well as different colors.|,|However, it is a less useful construction than the back-filling one, since the warp threads have to be set very closely and a heavyweight warp thread might cause difficulties in the opening of the shed.|,|Another method of producing a heavier fabric than is possible in a single-layered construction is the back-warp weave, which adds warp threads to the back to be interwoven.|,|is, as long as no problem of different tension between them occurs.|,|A back-filling fabric could have a plain-weave face and a twill backing or many other combinations, as long as a balance between the front and back weave is preserved; that.|,|As a by-product, such a fabric could have also different weave structures in front and back, as well as, of course, different colors.|,|There are innumerable other weave constructions, developed not merely of the basic weaves and preserving their original functions, as elaborations but for further specific functional purposes.|,|In fact, it is easy to construct hundreds of them.|,|or by omitting some sti tchers, innumerable crepe weaves can he developed.|,|By adding tying points, or stitchers, to an original basic design, a satin or perhaps a twill.|,|In 1586, Anton Moller of Danzig is said to have invented a mechanical ribbon loom, |,|His plans, however·, were never put into practice.|,|it operates single warp threads within a limited range and therefore resorts to repeats across the width of the fabric This, in combinntion with the great fineness of threads and the great number that now were manageable, led to the art of elaborate pattern weaving in compound constructions.|,|The The various types of draw looms are called, according to their specific devices for raising groups of single threads, &quot;button Looms&quot; or &quot;simple looms.&quot;|,|Thus, if a cord was raised, it would raise with it, for in­stance, all first threads within a repeat of a design.|,|those with warp threads which had the same position within a repeat of a design were combined.|,|And with an wlongated weight at its end.|,|each with an eye through which a warpthread was drawn|,|Printed in the United States of America lSBN o 289 37004.3|,|No part of this publication may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system, or transmitted, in any form or by any means, electronic, Mechanical, photocopying, recording, or otherwise, without the prior written permission of the publisher.|,|First published in Great Britain in 1974 by Studio Vista Publishers 35 Red Lion Square, London WC1R4SG First published in the United States of America by Wesleyan University Press Middletown, Connecticut All rights reserved.|,|Chapter One, &quot;Weaving, Hand,&quot;

flat, ribbed, close, heavy fabric can be pro­duced, suited for pictorial textiles.|,|A technique that has been used in the Near East and Far East is Soumak.|,|However highly developed they are, though, their more limited scope becomes apparent when they are compared with the more ad­ venturous use of threads in the ancient American pieces.|,|They are developed from the basic weaving structures, and thus the figures preserve the essential weaving formation.|,|Of infinite phantasy within the world of threads, conveying strength or playfulness, mystery or the reality of their surround­ings, endlessly varied in presentation and construction, even though bound to a code of basic concepts, these textiles set a standnrd of achievement that is unsurpassed.|,|Where reilief effects are believed to strengthen the presentation, they are added and worked out imaginatively and skillfully, as are other desirable supports.|,|A unique method, for instance, is that of interlocking not only the weft but the warp itself.|,|There are also the highly intelligent and often intricate inventions of lines or inter­locking forms.|,|There are those, large or small, of the Tiahuanaco period, for instance- tapestries in the pictorial as well as the technical sense- showing the deities of their Pantheon; or works from other periods, full of the life of their world.|,|Works of art, to my mind, are the ancient Peruvian pieces, preserved by an  arid climate and excavated after hundreds and even thousands of years.|,|Only in exceptional cases, for instance, in the examples illustrated here, where artists worked mainly with flat areas, are they works of art.|,|Again, we are here led away from pronounced lineation and contours toward a surface active only through the slight optical vibration of intersect-|,|For the subservient character we have sought for the fabric from the start directs our decisions and precludes loud in­strumentation.|,|of gaiety or somberness, of monumentality or caprice, all within, though modified by, the thus-far established framework.|,|We have in our hands powerful means of articulation - directional elements such as verticals, horizontals, diagonals, squares, as basic examples, in the weaver&apos;s terms, warp or weft stripes, twills, checks, etc.|,|And to foresee we need a contemplative state of mind.|,|We like things today that are light - light as the opposite of heavy and light as the opposite of dark. W e must learn to detect, in particular occasions, manifestations of general developments; that is, we must learn to foresee.|,|We for a must learn to sense those elements of form that respond to our formal needs.|,|We now have arrived at that stage of designing which demands our finest &quot;ear,&quot; for we must try to discern the formal currents of our period in history that are on the verge of crystallizing and that may become part of our language of form, or may again become part of it.|,|The synthetic fiber is mothproof and mildewproof and, intersecting the linen, it will reduce by the percentage of its use the mildew problem, unsolved in the case of linen.|,|Since, where large areas are involved, the problem of fading is unavoidable, a solution that circumvents dyeing alto­gether can only be welcomed.|,|Again, this original white will stay white under exposure to light, and the hard surface of the fiber will retain only a small amount of dust.|,|Designing as Visual Organizalion : 77 intersected by a weft of strawlike synthetic yarn, white and glossy in its original state, the dull natural linen will take on life by contrast, and a subtle in natural-to-white tones could be developed, as well as a play on the play scale from dull to sparkling, even light-reflecting.|,|Plate 39. Arrangement made by nature as contrast to arrangement made by design.|,|Plate 38. Studies made byy puncturing paper.|,|Plate 13 The fundamental constructions.|,|for the procedure of weaving is merely a matter of inference.|,|Of course, more than the thread construction has to be identified in the analysis of a cloth : the color of each warp and each filling thread has to be marked at the edge of the draft; the twist of the yarn and its color, as well as the material it is made of, have to be indicated: so do the number of warp and filling threads per inch, centimeter, or any given space.|,|An additional aid in the process of dissecting a both is a magnifying glass.|,|46 On Weaving are traced instead of filling threads.|,|Just as a sculpture of stone that contents itself to live within the limits of its stone nature is superior in formal|,|The horizontal-vertical intersecting of the two separate systems of thread is of great consequence for the formative side of weaving.|,|Where, for instance, the threads intersect diagonally in re­lation to the edge of the fabric, or radially from a center, we have a braided material: where only one thread is used to build up the material, we have a knitted or crocheted one; where threads intertwine or loop around each other, we have a lace or a net fabric.|,|Wherever a fabric is formed in a different manner we are not dealing with a weaving.|,|Of these three it is the plain weave that embodies the sum total of weaving and therewith reaches back the furthest.|,|With only a few exceptions, all other constructions are elaborations or combinations of the basic three: the plain weave, the twill, and the satin weave.|,|The fundamental constructions, in common with all fundamental proc­esses, have a universal character and are used today, as they were in our early history, here and everywhere.|,|Thus, with a long glance backward we can discern the rise of the technique of weaving, and with a long glance forward we may see it perhaps dim­ming in its dominance.|,|These usu­ally demand laborious tailoring or complicated draping to give them shape.|,|58 : On Weaving from the horizontal vertical construction of woven materials.|,|ln an economy-minded age, the possibility of an off-balance|,|Where this is lacking in a fabric, threads will easily draw apart or pile up, spoiling appearance as much as usefulness.|,|Another consequence of the use of a reed- which cannot be listed on the positive side though it is not an impediment - is the Mechanical nature of the spacing of the warp threads.|,|Commonly, in weaving, only one warp thread is drawn in between dents, thus eliminating entirely the use of deflected warp threads.|,|Only neighboring threads, usually not more than two, can be used in this manner.|,|warp threads can be crossed that are entered into the same space between dents.|,|and thereby produce a gauze weave, that is, lace effects.|,|This meant that he could cross warp threads, for instance.|,|the weaver was free to manipulate the warp within the scope set by the shedding arrangement he was using.|,|The reed , as part of the batten , added to this its own, though minor, limitations.|,|Greater evenness of the cloth resulted, and wider weavings could be attempted without added effort.|,|No longer was it necessary to in­sert the batten in to the opened shed after every new weft thread that had been entered; for now it was always in place and had only to be pulled lightly to fall by its own weight against the weft, pounding it uniformly across the whole width of the fabric and simultaneously keeping the warp evenly spaced.|,|They are fastened to a light frame, thus foming what is still called the reed.|,|28: On Weaving which the warps pass are of reed or, today, of wire.|,|Figured ribs, developed by placing a rib unit A in a twill Formation B .|,|But when the mat­er of usefulness is involved, we plainly and without qualification use our characteristics: forms that, however far they may deviate in their final development, are intrinsically geometric.|,|To turn from &quot;looking at&quot; to action: we grow cabbages in straight rows and are not tempted by nature&apos;s fanciful way of planting to scaner them about.|,|Aud here we can rcognize the essence of designing, a visually comprehensible, before us simplified organization of forms that is distinct from nature&apos;s secretive and complex working.|,|Here we have, then , natural and man made forms in contradistinction.|,|What we see is a free flow of forms intersected here and there by straight lines, rectangles, circles, and evenly drawn curves; that is, by shapes of great regularity.|,|CHAPTER TEN Designing as Visual Organization It is safe, I suppose, to assume that today most if not all of us have had the experience of looking down from an airplane onto this earth.|,|The Far East, of course, had this idea already long ago in the form of scrolls.|,|And if these include a work of art that is to sustain our spirits, it may be that we will take along a woven picture as a portable mural, something that can be rolled up for transport.|,|Just as our clothes are getting lighter and are increasingly geared to movement, so also will it be with other things that are to acompany us.|,|we move more often and always faster from place to place, and we will turn to those things that will least.|,|Plate 107 In our time, though, and for some time to come, threads can , I believe , serve as an expressive medium.|,|Experimental - that is, hold searching for new ways of conveying meaning - these attempts to conquer new territory even trespass at times into that of sculpture.|,|it is form- whatever form it may be - that is, I feel, our salvation .|,|Limitlessness leads to nothing but formlessness, a melting into nowhere.|,|Our playfulness today often loses its sense of direction and becomes no more than a bid for attention, rather than a convincing innovation.|,|But it is here, I believe, that we can learn most.|,|70 : On Weaving outstanding examples of textile art.|,|Combination weave;

marked according to the system of notation.|,|If the shorthand of draft notation as discussed above proves to be a use­ful tool in the construction of weaves, it is equally helpful in the analysis of weaves- that is, in the tracing- of a construction already executed.|,|It is amazing to see what complicated reporting is often resorted to, instead of transcribing the thread construction into the code of draft writing.|,|In historical research work, also, the general adoption of this system of notation.|,|The construction of a weave can be understood by reading the draft, instead of having to go through the lengthy process of actual execution.|,|Lengthy descriptions of the execution of a weave, giving the threading, the tie-up of the loom, and finally the sequence of weav­ing operations, can be easily reduced to this simple notation, which gives all the necessary information.|,|The unit should thus be recognizable at first glance and convey immediately the number of warp and filling threads needed for the construc­tion of the weave.|,|first unit clearly from the repeats, it has to be marked as such.|,|Loom, Santa Ana Hueytlalpan (after Bodil Christensen).|,|5.

the one who is making a thing new in form.|,|Let us pursue this matter of designing a little further, now that we have established in our mind where its beginning lies and where its ultimate goal.|,|Obviously, then, regardless of the material and the method of working it, designing is or should be methodical planning, whether of simple or intricately organized forms; and if done imaginatively and sensitively, designing can become art.|,|They are giving us, instead of massive contour, exposed structure; instead of opaqueness, transmission of light.|,|It is interest­ing to see how today&apos;s artists, for example our sculptors, are exploring new media and are thereby fundamentally changing the sculptural process from the traditional method of cutting away to one of joining.|,|Any material, any working procedure, and any method of pro­duction, manual or industrial, can serve an end that may be art.|,|For we certainly realize that there are no exclusive materials reserved for art, though we are often told otherwise.|,|We must conclude, then, that it is the thoughtfulness and care and sensitivity in regard to form that makes a house turn into art, and that it is this degree of thoughtfulness, care, and sensitivity that we should try to attain.|,|Usefulness does not prevent a thing, anything, from being art.|,|But surely these can all be, like a painting or music, works of art.|,|We do not speak of design­ing a picture or a concerto, but of designing a house, a city, a bowl, a fabric.|,|&quot;Designing&quot;

In the combination of linen and the plain weave, we had the mutual supporting of common traits; in the combination of silk and the plain weave, we have a clash of traits producing a material with new and distinctive characteristics.|,|So striking is this new combination that the plain weave acquires still an­other name when used with silk: the taffeta weave.|,|Every weave has, of course, a material that seems best suited to its spe­cial features; or, the other way around, every fiber has a weave in which its specialty seems to be exhibited most advantageously.|,|A twill forms a much more pliable material than does the plain weave, and thus the softness of the wool will be accentuated.|,|Also the more widely spaced imersections of warp and weft allow the threads to be set more closely, as we noted before, and thus makes for a heavier material, increasing the wool&apos;s capacity to preserve warmth.|,|One reason for not using a satin weave with wool - a combination which would also make for a soft, pliable, and closely packed material - is that here the threads float over too many threads of either warp or weft to sustain hard wear; they may easily be snagged and form ungainly loops on the surface.|,|The twill weave strikes just the right balance of pliability and practicality for wear.|,|Wool in a twill weave is the classical combination we know as tweeds.|,|Twills in cotton form the washable materials of our work clothes - of our overalls for instance - the firmly packed fabrics embodying the typical characteristics of both the cotton and the twill.|,|It is softer than taffeta, not as impractical as satin, and smoother than a twill woven in any other material.|,|Again we see the twill appearing in our clothing material.

1925 Such have been, up to the present day, the great changes undergone by what, around seventeen years ago, was called Cubism.|,|If there has been a mistake, it is a mistake on the part of those who still do not understand that, already, in the renewal of contemporary taste, the western world, wanting to renew its life, is beginning to change its cast of mind, the very shape of its way of thinking.|,|So we can conclude that Cubism has broken through the barrier that was put up between art and that sort of painting that claimed to be more pure - easel painting.|,|In all the various initiatives that are being undertaken wherever large scale commerce exercises its influence, Cubist painting is the only sort that can hold its own.|,|But in the context of pure art, it is an obvious nonsense.&apos;|,|Cubism is, in fact, at the origin of the whole of the modern style.|,|Like the manufacture of guns and of poisoned gas, Cubism excited an appetite for wealth.|,|I do not want to expand on the quick role-changes assumed by particular individuals.|,|It thought, perhaps, that by accepting such patronage, it could ensure its continued existence.|,|During those terrible years which followed each other, one after the other, between 1914 and 1919, the representatives of Cubism were dispersed and tormented by thoughts of what the future might hold, and Cubism itself was condemned by the means that were typical of the time - the pressure of patriotic calumnies (13).|,|But Metzinger, clear- headed as a physicist, had already discovered those rudiments of construction without which nothing can be done.|,|The others - and I assure you that I include myself among them - continued their researches in an empirical fashion, with successes or failures depending on greater or lesser degrees of talent or good luck.|,|But what an intelligence he had, what knowledge, what wisdom, what prudence.|,|everything he knew he said, clearly, and his work is a rich source of lessons for young painters who cannot, if they have any respect for the craft they have chosen, believe that painting is at the mercy of irresponsibility masquerading as genius, a mere cover for incurable intellectual laziness.|,|Like any natural, physical reality, painting, understood in this way, will touch anyone who knows how to enter into it, not through their opinions on something that exists independently of it, but through its own existence, through those inter- relations, constantly in movement, which enable us to transmit life itself.|,|There is a concrete act that has to be realised, a reality to be produced - of the same order as that which everyone is prepared to recognise in music, at the lowest level of the esemplastic scale, and in architecture, at the highest (21).|,|As we can see straightaway, it is not a matter of describing, nor is it a matter of abstracting from, anything that is external to itself.|,|The chief characteristic of decorative painting is, of course, the very great quantity of means that are developed as a direct result of the technique employed.|,|But what is there that is so terrible about decorative painting?|,|into the state of indecision that characterised the work of Cézanne.|,|Descriptive painting is beginning to give way to the living wall.|,|In that field of human activity which has given birth to Cubism, I see definite signs of the renewal of what used to be called &apos;great decorative painting&apos;.|,|It is easy, in the world of humanity at the present time, to see the signs of that organic incoherence which is the prelude to the end that all aging biological systems have to undergo.|,|The Renaissance marked a decisive moment in the separation of two casts of mind corresponding to two essential periods of life: the one had risen from birth to adulthood, the other was to descend from adulthood to death - the first was organic, the second was destined to become disorganised and disarticulated through the illusion that liberty was being accorded to each of its individual parts.|,|Similar changes take place in the fields of dance, music, poetry, literature taken as a whole, sculpture and, in the art of furniture, using the term in its widest possible sense.|,|By contrast, when architecture begins to decline, indicating a decline in the esemplastic power of the world as a whole, painting, by a process of repercussion, breaking free from the order that is collapsing, delivered up to its own devices, becomes the picture.|,|vision in time for a of our specific need adequately the more 87

however, Gleizes had been increasingly preoccupied by the question of colour, and this had led him more and more to appreciate the importance of the pre-war work of Robert Delaunay, and the much more

external world.|,|This period of development was profoundly moving and even heroic, but it had to be transcended.|,|The tension which for Kahnweiler and his followers was the glory of Cubism was, for Gleizes, a consequence of the ignorance of the Cubists: a struggle between what they knew and what they could still only dimly perceive.|,|Without it, there would be no struggle, and no tension.|,|For Gleizes, the success of Cubism in the popular commercial arts (as opposed to the doubts that were being cast on it in the rarefied commercial world of the art dealers, which Gleizes always disliked) was a proof of its natural strength, and a good reason for persevering with it.|,|Gleizes quotes a newspaper article of 1928 which says that, while Cubism had been a nonsense in the field of &apos;pure art&apos;, it had now found its natural home in the applied arts.|,|Paradoxically, however, this was also the period in which a superficial adaptation of Cubism had triumphed in the decorative arts in the style known as &apos;art deco&apos;.|,|Dada, which ridiculed the seriousness of Cubism (with Gleizes as a favourite target); Surrealism, which marked an altogether different approach towards painting; and the new schools of non-representational art, which had some claim to being in a line of succession from Cubism, but which still broke radically with the particular methods of construction which it had developed.|,|It felt early on that its principles could not be found in the rules that had been developed in Greece in the age of Pericles, nor in those that had

ages of human history were simply declared to be rudimentary, primitive, full of good intentions, but absolutely lacking in any quality that could possibly deserve to be held up as an example.|,|Convinced as I am of the human importance of what has been called Cubism, I have always tried to search out its true causes in the collaboration, whether conscious or not, of a group, and I

aspirations, is all that remains, because it is indispensable, of the great decorative painting of the past.|,|They compelled the development of an approach that was genuinely esemplastic and which, dependent as it was on the technical means employed, was inevitably bound to produce a return to the spirit of decorative painting.|,|But that was, and still is, too simple for minds for whom progress can only occur as a matter of increasing complications.|,|Yet it passed, if not unnoticed, at least unappreciated.|,|This was a real challenge to the Renaissance cast of mind that had not been superseded merely because the external appearances of things were being expressed metaphorically.|,|Their pictures were still deformations of an essentially descriptive and atmospheric base, but, as they reached the limits at once of the break-up of the image and also of the two dimensional geometry which held the work together, they began to touch something of a more substantial nature.|,|BRAQUE AND PICASSO - RESTORATION OF THE CRAFT Braque and Picasso pushed this independence as far as it would go during the first period of Cubism, but, in their case, there is something more than just this movement in a direction that had been fixed since the time of the Renaissance.|,|For this they employed a method of dissolving the whole shape into small geometric units, and saw to it that the multitude of elements did not destroy the original subject as an entity.|,|Besides the emotional upheaval caused by the startling extension of the traditional pictorial elements into a new vision, the distortions and strange transformations of well-known subject matter produced, in addition, an attack on all pictorial fixations originating in the renaissance.|,|In the first place, the spectator&apos;s surprise came, to a great extent, from distortions of recognizable objects and from the wit with which these deviations from the habitual rendering of nature were used for a binocular characterization of the object.|,|Tearing apart the old visual conception, the cubist painters originated a new means of rendering, as well as a space articulation.|,|First, because of the convention that every painting must be rooted in nature.|,|Now I realize that their clinging to subject-matter was inevitable.|,|I see today that this step was the logical continuation of the cubist paintings that I had admiringly studied.|,|I chose simple geometrical forms as a step towards such objectivity.|,|The liberation from the necessity to record was their genesis.|,|My transparent pictures around 1921 became completely freed of elements remi- niscent of nature.|,|Although at the time I was without the necessary skill and means, this idea was responsible, with some changes, for my later experiments with stage sets and with molded transparent plastics.|,|I painted as if colored light was projected on a screen, and other colored lights superimposed over it.|,|I became interested in painting-with-light, not on the sur- face of canvas, but directly in space.|,|I suspect this is why my work since those days has been only a paraphrase of the original problem, light.|,|The capacities of one man seldom allow the handling of more than one problem area.|,|14 9 Siedlung dessau-törten schnitt vom typ des baujahres 1926 die rapiddeckenbalken sind eingezeichnet|,|Such an idea goes against all the experience of our history.|,|I have stated on several occasions that men such as Sérusier, Maurice Denis, Seurat, Cross, Odilon Redon were, in their different ways, pioneers, without knowing it, of the order that is in the process of being established (2).|,|Cézanne was not the only one who worked on them; they also underwent the influence of Van Gogh and Gauguin, who were not so far removed as people have later liked to pretend from the working out of the new thought.|,|The worst contradictions pass unnoticed as if he had the infallibility of a god.|,|But the following generation, themselves quite hopelessly divided, caught between what had been made of them by an old cast of mind that had lost all creative power, and a vague longing for a renewed cast of mind - they raised the painter of Aix up to the pinnacle of greatness, simply because he had been unable himself to come to any decision.|,|The contradictions that are fundamental to his work are themselves the reason for its popularity; everyone can find in it what they want.|,|In opposition to the immobile means of expression that the Academy was teaching, these painters threw down like a challenge a mobile expression; to volumes situated in space they preferred the living dynamism of coloured form in evolution.|,|Back 13 An account of this &apos;patriotic&apos;
